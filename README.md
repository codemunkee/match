# Memory Game Project

A simple card matching game that demonstrates the use of jQuery for manipulating the DOM, in particular, facilitating interaction with the game's player.

Behind the scenes a `State` object keeps track of the current status of the game. Used later for gauging the player's performance.

## In the future

It would be fun to keep a server-side leaderboard and possibly do some better player performance ranking with the time to complete the game (today it just looks at the number of moves, though the time required to complete all matches *is* tracked).
